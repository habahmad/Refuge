# Refuge
[Project in early stages]

A simple journalling website which allows a user to come in and enter their thoughts about the day. They can decide how they feel and select a mood and recieve a response from a character they like accordingly. The response will either be some encouraging advice, a comforting message or a helpful reminder. It serves as a quiet place of self-reflection and comfort.
